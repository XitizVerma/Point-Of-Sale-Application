A Point Of Sale is a application that is used to process transactions by retail customers in real time.

A Point Of Sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. 

A POS transaction may occur in person or online, with receipts generated either in print or electronically. Cloud-based POS systems are becoming increasingly popular among merchants. 
POS systems are increasingly interactive, particularly in the hospitality industry, and allow customers to place orders and reservations and pay bills electronically.
